    <h3>What is the purpose of the game?</h3><br>
    The purpose of the game is to break all the boxes without letting the ball hit the bottom of the screen. <br>
    <h3>What element(s) are controlled by the player?</h3><br>
    We can control the bar at the bottom of the screen that the ball bounces off of to keep the ball moving and to get it to hit all the boxes.<br>
    <h3>What element(s) are controlled by the computer?</h3><br>
    When the boxes get destroyed, the speed of the ball, how the ball moves and how it bounces off of objects.<br>
    <h3>How does the player control their element.</h3><br>
    they move the platform to the right or left using the a key for left and d key to move right.<br>
    <h3>How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)</h3><br>
    Movement is based on the velocity of the ball it the x and y directions which are determined by the computer and changed when the ball hits an object. Positions behave by being generated and the boxes staying where they are generated until destroyed. Randomness is behaved to generate randomly speed randomly when the ball hits and object and the direction of the velocity might change randomly.<br>
    <h3>If you were to program this, what classes would you write?</h3><br>
    Ball Class, Box class, Platform class.<br>
    <h3>If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?</h3><br>
    We would use an array for the Box class because there are a bunch of boxes and We would use a matrix array since the boxes lie on different rows and columns. We would store boxes in the array.
